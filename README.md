# My Personal Project

## A Bullethell Autoscroller Game



**What will the application do?**

My idea for the personal project is a 2-Dimensional "Bullethell" game where the objective is to shoot enemies
and avoid projectiles in an auto-scrolling environment for as long as possible. The player will control a spaceship 
that can move up, down, left, or right. They will use right click to shoot their own bullets. The player will also be
able to hit spacebar to temporarily be invincible to enemy projectiles. It will also feature a menu on startup where the 
user can change the appearance of their controlled ship-character before starting the game. Enemies will appear
periodically and shoot bullets in various patterns that the player must dodge. IF the player gets hit once, the game
ends.


**Who will use it?**

Anyone interested in 2D bullethell-style games will be interested in this application. There are no real limitations on
the intended user.


**Why is this project of interest to you?**

I've always been interested in game design, and I saw this project as an opportunity to get my feet wet in actually
making a game. As for why this game in particular, I thought it offered a nice middle ground between a completely basic
and uninspiring game (like a pong copy for example), and a game that was too complex for the given timeframe. Though,
perhaps my scope is still too large for a summer project.
